## **Beta Version (Loop/Stack)**
**Stack:**  
`Cozmo ⇔ Pi 5`

**Functions:**
- Wake up  
- Explore safely (smooth + random motion)  
- Utilize OpenCV for face detection  
- Expressive screen behavior  
- Basic path following  

---

## **Pre-V1**
**Stack:**  
`Cozmo ⇔ Pi 5 ⇔ Webserver (optional)`  
`|   |   |`  
`c1  c2  c3`

**Functions:**
- Wake up (expressive)  
- Improved exploration (interactive, purposeful)  
- Basic facial recognition  
- Object recognition (basic shapes)  
- Cube recognition (basic)  
- Enhanced screen expressions  
- Advanced path following and creation  
- Possible web app integration

## **V1**
**Stack:**  
Same as Pre-V1

**Functions:**
- All Pre-V1 features plus:  
  - Return to charger  
  - Cube interaction  
  - Minigame(s)  
  - Environmental/mood-based sound effects

  - Area mapping  
  - More minigames  
  - Improved spatial awareness  
  - Better exploration using mapping  
  - Basic sound generation + prerecorded sounds  

---

## **V2**
**Stack:**  
Same as V1.5

**Functions:**
- All V1.5 features plus:  
  - Basic AI implementation

---

## **Beyond**
**Future Goals:**
- Fully dedicated and trained AI (via reinforcement learning and Isaac Lab) for movement  
- Separate interaction AI (handles user-facing behavior)  
- Optimized for continued use on Raspberry Pi 5 (core features retained)  
- Block-coding interface for all skill levels  
- Personality surpassing Vector  
- 3D map visualization created by Cozmo  
- Advanced object recognition AI, trainable by user on the fly  
- Full packaging for Wirepod integration
